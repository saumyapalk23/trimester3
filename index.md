5.1 Video Notes: Beneficial and Harmful Effects 
WII and iPhone
WII before iPhone
Both have accelerometers, in development for same periods of time
Accelerometer part of automotive industry → airbags when too fast; prevents injury
Quadcopter: brain w a sense, accelerometer
Ppl complete tasks by changing things through innovation
Miltirotor
Benefits: deliveries, finding ppl, easy photography
Harmful: flying in unreg. zones, illegal/dangerous, privacy concerns
WII
Controller: gets ppl active
Harmful: broken tv’s, injuries
Not every effect of innovation anticipated
Effects of comp innovation are dangerous/beneficial at the same time, to many ppl or same person even
Ppl create computing innovations (3d printers)
Advances in computing generated creativity in other fields
LOOK AT FLOWCHARTS! Assume anything will work unless stated otherwise
Beneficial and Harmful Effects.2
Comp innovation can impact beyond purpose
Ex: internet was beneficial, now ppl spend more time on internet than sleep
Dopamine feedback loops → like, comment, etc: happier
Leads to sleep deprivation, depression, anxiety, impulsivity
Tiktok PSA lol!
Computing innovations used in ways that are unintended; programmers try to consider these ways and potential benefits/harms
Microtransactions
Little payments for cosmetics, paywall to functionality, sometimes pay to win, etc.
Comp innovations may harm society, economy, culture
Impossible for a programmer to consider all the ways a computing innovation is used
Rapid sharing of a program results in impacts beyond intended purpose/control
5.2 Video Notes: Digital Divide
Issues that contribute to divide
Internet access varies bw all areas
Divide → differing access
Socioeconomic: how much money comes into house each yr
Geographic: live  w not that many ppl; no Internet
Demographics (Age, Religion) → less likely to have these things
Countries: computers not common in rural areas, small # of websites, internet to protect/advocate govt, high surveillance to protect govt.
Digital divide affects grps, individuals, raises issues, affected by actions of orgs, individuals, etc.
5.3 Video 1: Computing Bias
How bias exists in computing divisions
Netflix?
Lots of data from viewers
Explicit data: thumbs, name, add, etc. + implicit: what watched, binged, style of show
Bias
Netflix exclusives featured ahead of most
Computing innovations reflect existing human biases into algorithms or in the data used by innovation
Programmers shld take action to reduce algorithmic bias for computing innovations to combat existing human biases
Biases embedded in all software (unintentional/intentional)
Call of duty → doesn’t block ppl to play game, but geared for teens
Casual: sugary things; certain demographic
Facebook vs insta vs snap vs tiktok
Tiktok: geared to ppl who like fast vids
Facebook: only for boomers
5.4 Video 1: Crowdsourcing
Explain how ppl participate in problem solving processes at scale
Public data sets
Kaggle: many things to offer, courses, tutorials, comps, etc.
Notebooks to house code/data
Also google datasets, data.gov, local govt
Widespread access to info and data facilitates identification of problems, development of solutions, dissemination of results
Distributed computing
Protein folding @ stanford
Boinc @ berkeley

Crowdsourcing
Spotify! Collaborative playlists
Algorithm: how it offers music based on listening activity
Metadata-write-in
Crowdfunding
Kickstarter; pitch idea, ppl give money to develop it and make profit (shark tank but less intense_
Indiegogo → nonprofit, too many of these
Blockchain
Cryptocurrency
Other tokens (concert tickets)
